## Project Status
Project is:  _complete_ 

## Room for Improvement
While Boostrap was utilized in building this site and the navigation bar and image
gallery are fully responsive (which was the main objective of the project), the
rest of the site is not responsive. The following improvements could be made:
- The hero image text should decrease in size for smaller screens.
- The "about" section text should decrease on smaller screen sizes and move under
the "about" header.
- The map should decrease in size and move under the description on smaller screens.
